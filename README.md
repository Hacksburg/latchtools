# latchtools
This repository contains a set of tools to work with the [Latchburg](https://github.com/Hacksburg/latchburg) framework. Currently, there is one tool available, latchscan.

## latchscan
Latchscan scans a latchburg-created log file for entries for a specific day and prints them to stdout in CSV format, which allows for redirection elsewhere. Integrated emailing functionality is planned for a future release.
